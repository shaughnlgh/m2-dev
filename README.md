# Magento 2 Developer Setup Guide

The purpose of this guide is to show how to setup a Magento 2 environment easily and to ensure faster setups when onboarding new developers within your 
project.

This guide has been written for MacOs, however can be adapted to cater for other OS's as well. Having said this, we will assume:
- you are a MacOS user,
- you know some Docker basics,
- you are familiar with using terminal or similar,
- you have some basic git knowledge,
- and you are setting up a new or existing Magento 2 project.

The guide has been broken up into several sections. In each section I will to provide as much detail as possible, where relevant and guide you through the installation / setup steps. These steps can be added to a shell script in order to make setup easier, however we will keep them separate for this guide.
